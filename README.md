# PPP_Internship

This Internship is based on the work of [GIT](https://github.com/schelterlabs/jenga).

- PPP_train.py: Trains a BlackBox-Model and a Gausian Process with meta features.
- PPP_serving.py: Uses that GP to detect, which HPs are the best, during serving time.
- PPP_class.py: Calculates the meta features.
